## Recursion

![Recursion](images/recursion_final.png)

Recursion is an important part of this text for one major reason. Other data structures utilize recursion to solive their problems.

### The parts of a recursive function

- The base case.

Perhaps you've run into an example of "stack level too deep" before. The base case is the section that tells our program to stop.

- The recursive case

The counter to our base case. If the base case is not met, we run this side of the function.

Let's look at a simple counter program. It will count down from a number to 0.

```
function countdown(n) {
  if (n < 0) {
    return undefined
  } else {
    console.log(n)
    return countdown(n-1)
  }
}
```

Versus the same iterative solution

```
function countdown(n) {
  for (var i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
    console.log(i)
  }
}
```

Our base case is `if (n < 0)`. This is telling our program to stop when our condition is met. If it is absent, we will infinitely loop, counting down forever.

The recursive case did something, then returned a smaller version of the exact same program.

> _The goal of a recursive function is to continually call itself with a smaller and smaller problem until we meet our base case._

### The call stack

In the recursive case, you'll notice we're not returning a value but instead, an entirely newly invoked function. By this, we can assume that recursive functions _do_ take up more memory than an iterative one. In addition, we can also trace the call stack, the order of functions called as until we get to a base case, none of these called functions returns.

Let's use a classic Fibonacci recursive function as an example. The fibonacci sequence is:

```
n     | 1  2  3  4  5 
-----------------------
value | 1  1  2  3  5
```

And the code:

```
// abbreviated "fibonacci" to "fib"
function fib(n) {
  if (n < 2) {
    return n
  } else {
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
  }
}
```

Lets trace `fib(5)`. We know it should return 5.

```
            fib(5)
            /    \
       fib(4)     fib(3)
      /    \       |    \ 
  fib(3)  fib(2) fib(2) fib(1)
   /   \   [1]    [1]     [1]
fib(2) fib(1)
[1]      [1]
```

We can see the Tree structure that is created and see the `1`'s returned, 5 of them.

Technically, we haven't returned a value until each branch gets all the way to its base case. The values of each function then "bubble up" back to the orginal call of `fib(5)`.

### Conclusion

Recursion was needed a lot more in languages and frameworks that did not have proper loops as we know them today. It is still used in a variety of fields such as [graphics in game development](https://books.google.com/books?id=3ljRBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA122&lpg=PA122&dq=game+development+recursion+graphics&source=bl&ots=5LX2SaW1c1&sig=RvrzzWkju9udKcRqf73vpg0FfCI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmqtDl96vYAhWHgVQKHYqyD_cQ6AEIMzAB#v=snippet&q=recursion&f=false). In addition, throughout the coming chapters of this text we'll use recursion on data structures that leverage it well.

### Questions

#### #1

[Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) is a divide and conquer algorithm.
- Implement it in JavaScript, or a language of your choice.
- Ensure you understand how it operates recursively.

#### #2

Try calling our `fib` function with an argument of `100`. You'll see that it'll take a very long time.
- Using [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization), try and write a function that will return `fib(100)` in linear time (_O(n)_).

> _Hint: it may not be a recursive function._

#### #3

Write a function called `multiply` that accepts 2 numbers as arguments. Write this as a recursive function without using the `*` (multiply) operator.

```
function multiply(n, m) {
  // code
}

multiply(8, 7) == 56 // true
```

#### #4

We want to recursively print stars in a pyramid fashion (rotated 90 degrees to the right), using an asterisk "*". We want to write a function called `starUp` that accepts 2 arguments. The integer we start at and the integer we end at.

Example:

```
starUp(0, 3)

// returns
*
**
***
**
*
```

The _only_ iterative part of your program is the below given helper function though bonus points if you implement a recursive solution of it:

```
function printStars(n) {
  var stars = ''
  for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    stars += '*'
  }

  console.log(stars)
}
```
